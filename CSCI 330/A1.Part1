Name:             Brandon Tweed
Graduation Date:  Summer 2005
CSCI Courses:     CSCI 464, CSCI 530, this course
UNIX Experience:  I worked with Unix when I took 241. I've also worked 
with the Cygwin environment and I've played around with Slackware Linux.
Optional Information:

I'm a big fan of TV shows such as The Family Guy, the Simpsons, and the 
Daily Show with John Stewart. This class looks to be fun because it has 
nothing to do with MVS or assembler.
